# 2. What is CIDR in IP Notation? Write a Program to accept the IP in CIDR from user and accept
# another plain IP and check the IP is matched with earlier IP in CIDR.
# E.g.
#            1. First IP in CIDR: 172.16.16.142/24
#            Second plain IP: 172.16.16.89
#             Result should be matched
#            2. First IP in CIDR: 172.16.16.142/24
#            Second plain IP: 172.16.1.47
#             Result should be not matched
